# mafia_game_api_php
A part of a hobby project for an online game for mobile devices.

A lot of the code makes little sense and could be done in a milion better ways, BUT!
The point of this whole thing is to checkout new bits with the newest PHP (8.1, as of starting it) and test the crap out of them to the point of absurdity.
